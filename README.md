Welcome to #golang-dasar!

This is a collection of files documenting my learning journey in the Go programming language (Golang). I pursued this learning material through the courses provided by Programmer Zaman Now and received guidance from the online course "Programming Go Lang: From Beginner to Advanced" on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/pemrograman-go-lang-pemula-sampai-mahir/). I want to emphasize that the explanations in this course are straightforward and easy to understand, while also presenting complex concepts in a structured and clear manner.

In this project, I aim to upload files that represent my commitment to understanding and mastering Go. My goal is to build further projects and enhance my skills in the world of Go programming.

I am delighted to share this project with fellow learners who are interested in exploring Go or anyone keen on delving into this programming language. I hope this collection of files can serve as inspiration and reference for you.

Let's continue to collaborate and learn together to achieve a deeper understanding of Go. Thank you for checking out this project!

Special thanks to the **@ProgrammerZamanNow** for the valuable Go programming resources!"
